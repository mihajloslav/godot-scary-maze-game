## 📍 About the Original

The original "Scary Maze Game" was designed to test your concentration... only to hit you with a jumpscare when you least expected it.
This version recreates the gameplay mechanics, but **does not include** the scare element or sounds — making it a perfect base for developers to build their own twists!
